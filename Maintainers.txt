In general, you should not privately email the maintainer. You should
email the edk2-devel list, but you can also Cc the maintainer.

Descriptions of section entries:

  L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area (default is edk2-devel)
     Patches and questions should be sent to the email list.
  M: Cc address for patches and questions (ie, the package maintainer)
  R: Package Reviewer: Cc address for patches and questions. Reviewers help
     maintainers review code, but don't have push access. A designated Package
     Reviewer is reasonably familiar with the Package (or some modules

                 much other than throw the odd patch in. See below.
     Orphan:     No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
                 role as you write your new code].
     Obsolete:   Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
                 it has been replaced by a better system and you
                 should be using that.
